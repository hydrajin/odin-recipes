  <p>A simple recipe for extra cheese pizza on top of the best homemade pizza dough. Makes one 12-inch pizza or you can make two pizzas from my entire crust recipe and double the toppings listed below.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pizza Crust</li>
    <li>1/2–3/4 cup (127-190g) pizza sauce, depending how much you like (homemade or store-bought)</li>
    <li>8 ounces sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1 and 1/2 cups (6oz or 168g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>2–3 Tablespoons (10-15g) grated parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>ground basil or Italian seasoning, to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare the ready made pizza crust and preheat the oven to 475°F (246°C)</li>
    <li>Top the dough with the pizza sauce, then the sliced mozzarella, then the shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, then sprinkle with basil.</li>
    <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes. For the last minute, I move the oven rack to the top rack to really brown the edges. (That’s optional)</li>
    <li>Slice hot pizza and serve immediately. Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer.</li>
  </ol>
